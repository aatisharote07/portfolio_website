## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed historical sales data to uncover hidden patterns, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and forecast future sales trends. The goal was to provide actionable insights that would support data-driven business decisions and help improve overall sales strategies.

## Key Activities

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis of historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and key performance drivers.
- **Insight Presentation**: Developed and presented actionable insights to stakeholders, helping to inform and shape future business strategies.
- **Forecasting**: Built and evaluated forecasting models to predict future sales performance with a high degree of accuracy.
