## Project Overview

I developed a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests films based on their similarity. The system uses metadata such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overviews to create a vector representation for each movie.

## Key Activities

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Built a filtering system using movie metadata to identify and rank similar films.
- **NLP & Vectorization**: Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and used cosine similarity to measure the likeness between movies.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: The system delivers the top 10 movie recommendations for any selected film, complete with dynamic visuals in a responsive design.
