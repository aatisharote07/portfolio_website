## Project Overview

As part of a job simulation with British Airways, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of over 3,400 customer reviews. The goal was to extract actionable insights on customer sentiment, service quality, and overall passenger experience to help inform business improvements.

## Key Activities

- **Web Scraping & Text Analysis**: Performed web scraping to collect real customer feedback from review platforms and conducted in-depth text analysis to identify key themes and sentiment.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built a predictive model to anticipate customer purchasing behavior based on their reviews, achieving 62% accuracy, 61% precision, and 60% recall.
- **Insight Generation**: Extracted and presented key insights on service quality and passenger experience to guide strategic decision-making.
