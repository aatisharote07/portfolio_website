## Project Overview

This project involved building a full data science pipeline to predict real estate prices in Gurgaon. I worked with a dataset of over 15,000 listings, performing web scraping, extensive data preprocessing, and advanced feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

## Key Activities

- **Data Pipeline**: Built a complete pipeline including web scraping, preprocessing, missing value imputation, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Applied and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR) using cross-validation and feature selection to identify the best performer.
- **Feature Engineering**: Performed advanced data cleaning and created new features, such as 'luxury scores', to significantly boost model performance and accuracy.
